Description: AVR development board IDE and built-in libraries
 Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
 flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists,
 designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive
 objects or environments.
 .
 This package will install the integrated development environment that
 allows for program writing, code verfication, compiling, and uploading
 to the Arduino development board. Libraries and example code will also
 be installed.
